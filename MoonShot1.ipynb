We aim to achieve the following objectives:\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Select effective technical indicators:\n","We will feed a number of technical indicators into the AI as additional training parameters, it will determine correlations between indicators and the increase in stock price.\n","From these technical indicator correlations we will select the most effective techincal indicators with the most correlation to a rise in stock price. \n","\n","---\n","\n","### Train a Neural Network:\n","We will train a multilayer neural network on historical market data and the corresponding stock price history as well as the technical indicators selected. This neural network will attempt to learn and potentially improve upon the initial strategy, potentially identifying new patterns or refining existing ones.\n","\n","We will consider the model a success if it is able to increase both the Win rate by 15% while maintaining the profit percentage.\n","\n","#### Throughout this notebook, we will document the development process, including:\n","\n","- Data acquisition and preparation\n","- Feature engineering and selection\n","- Building and training the neural network\n","- Evaluating the performance of MoonShot's strategy and the trained neural network\n","\n","---\n","\n","Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real-world trading without proper risk management and regulatory compliance.
